<h2> This is the Main Heading </h2>
<p>A <b> <q>Paragraph </q> </b>  consists of one or more sentences
    that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
    start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
    line.</p>
<h3> This is the Sub-Heading</h3>
<p> Text is easier to understand when it is split up
    into units of text.<br/> For example, <i> <hr/> A book may have
        chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
        each heading there will be one or more
        paragraphs.</i> </p>
